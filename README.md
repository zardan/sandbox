Zifro Sandbox is a simple game engine using [Zifro Mellis](https://github.com/zardan/compiler) & [Zifro Playground UI](https://github.com/zardan/ui) together to let the player create a voxel world of their own with customly programmed agents acting on each other.
Instead of the game stepping through your code slowly (ex: how ["Zifro Styra Podden"](https://github.com/zardan/car-controller) operates), we modified Mellis to be able to run at high speeds, while breaking at loops as a starting ground. The code runs at 20 clocks per second, i.e. 20 loop iterations per second.

This fast code execution, on multiple agents in parallel, together with a big library of useful functions, and an easily customized voxel world, gives the players a big playing ground to make a big variance of different games within. From platformers, to arcade games, racing games, tower defence, story driven adventures, to even strategy games. Then to be published on Zifro's website _(<https://zifro.se/>)_ and shared among friends.
